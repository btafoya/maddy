**Body:**
Dear maddy author, please tell me about the function of batch creating users.
I currently have a requirement to have the golang program automatically create users. I tried to directly insert the database credentials.db, but the inserted database user could not log in normally. I would like to ask for guidance on how I should do this so that I can automatically generate users without having to manually go to the terminal to create new users.

I inserted this picture using the program, but I can't log in normally
